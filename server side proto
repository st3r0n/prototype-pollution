++++++++++++++++DETECTION OF SERVER SIDE PROTO POLLUTION++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
note--> for loop i JS iterates over all properties that means it will onclude everytjhing from objects own property to protytpe property
now  for serverside prototype pollution we can look for anything that submits to the server and can we add __proto__ inside it wuth propertyname and  values
examples being the following
POST or PUT requests that submit JSON data to an application or API are prime candidates for this kind of behavior as it's common for servers to respond with a 
JSON representation of the new or updated object.
In this case, you could attempt to pollute the global Object.prototype with an arbitrary property as follows: 

POST /user/update HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
...
{
    "user":"wiener",                       and the server will return the property in response
    "firstName":"Peter",
    "lastName":"Wiener",
    "__proto__":{
        "foo":"bar"                      ------> so foo:bar will b included in response
    }
}
look for PUT nad POst request being sent to server

2. what if we dont have something like previous scenario where our polluted property is not reflected:
